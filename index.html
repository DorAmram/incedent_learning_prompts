Imagine it's 6 months from now. Our [specific system/feature/release] has just caused a major outage that took 4 hours to resolve and affected 80% of our users. 

Working backwards from this failure:
1. What are the 5 most likely technical root causes?
2. What human errors or process breakdowns led to this scenario?
3. Which of our current 'minor issues' cascaded into this major failure?
4. What made this incident especially difficult to diagnose and resolve?
